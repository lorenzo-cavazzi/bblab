[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab)
[![Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bblab/badge/?version=latest)](https://bblab.readthedocs.io)


bblab library implements useful image processing algorithms for the bblab. It's still pretty basic but it's meant to be expanded in the near future. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started

For the full documentation, including how to install and use the library, please follow this link: [bblab.readthedocs.io](https://bblab.readthedocs.io)

Should you prefer an offline version, the documentation is available as HTML and PDF in
the `/docs` repository folder.

## Contributing

Any library is meant to be flexible and reliable. A number of further parameters and
options may be added, and current functions may be improved as well. Every further
contribution is encouraged by the author.

Expanding unit tests would also be a good idea, especially to cover more function
parameters combinations and file system write operations.

Before pulling please remember to also update documentation and test cases (when
necessary), as well as the version numbers according to the
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) scheme.
