Install
=======

Here you can find different install procedures. Please choose the one that best fits
your needs. The Quick start section takes advantage of `pip` package manager to
install the library and all its dependencies in a convenient way.

Prerequisites
-------------

The library requires Python 3.4+. You can download it from
`Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_ or from your system package
manager.

If you are working on Linux, chances are that Python 3 is already installed. Check
your version by typing

>>> python --version
Python 3.6.5

In some linux distributions (like `Ubuntu <https://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ 18.04) you
can use Python 3 by invoking `python3` instead of `python`. This helps to maintain
compatibility with legacy software which expect `python` to invoke Python 2.

>>> python --version
Command 'Python' not found
>>> python3 --version
Python 3.6.5

Quick start
-----------

The easiest way to install bblab library is to use `pip`. It will automatically download
the last bblab package from `Github repository <https://github.com/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab>`_
and install it locally, along with any required dependency.

>>> pip install git+https://github.com/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab.git

In some linux distributions (like Ubuntu 18.04) you can use pip by invoking `pip3`

If you don't want to install git, you can manually download and unzip the library.
Please refer to the following section.

Advanced 
-----------

An advanced user may be interested in installing the library manually. Follow these
steps:


#. Download the library from `Github repository <https://github.com/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab>`_ and unzip it. From Linux you can use these commands

    >>> wget https://github.com/lorenzo-cavazzi/bblab/archive/master.zip
    >>> unzip master.zip
    >>> cd bblab-master

#. Compile the library

    >>> python setup.py sdist

#. Install the archive. Adjust file name according to the version

    >>> pip install dist/bblab-0.1.tar.gz

#. Cleanup. From Linux you can use these commands

    >>> cd..
    >>> rm master.zip
    >>> rm bblab-master -r
